                Hanabii was born in the dark ocean and lived alone for a long time. One day, it touched a small spark from a human experiment. That spark made Hanabii shine for the first time, filling its body with bright colors. Since then, it learned to use light to express feelings — joy, curiosity, and hope. Every time Hanabii shines, the ocean around it becomes more alive, as if celebrating with it.
